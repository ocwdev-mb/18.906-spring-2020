  caption: "The Hopf fibration shows how the three-sphere can be built by a collection\
    \ of circles\_parametrized by points on a two-sphere. This is a frame from [an\
    \ animation](https://youtu.be/AKotMPGFJYk) of fibers in the Hopf fibration over\
    \ various points on the two-sphere. (Image and animation courtesy of [Niles Johnson](https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf.html).)"
